# 📁Chapter-01:
 ## In this mini project, the following codes are simulated:
* In the first code named *Problem1*, the process of forming a random dataset using the skLearn library and classifying them has been done.
* In the code with the name of *Problem2* atatest fault detection **CWRU Bearing Dataset** call and using **Logistic Regression** machine model, the work of separating normal and fault data has been done.
* In the third code named *Problem3*, the process of calling the *Weather in Szeged 2006-2016* time series dataset and forecasting the weather data using **LS**, **RLS** and **WLS** methods.
