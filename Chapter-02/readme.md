## In this mini project, the following codes are simulated:
* In the first code named "Miniproject2_problem1_Triangle_area", the area inside a triangle is estimated using McCulloch-Pitts neurons.
* In the code named "Problem2_miniproject2_MLP_Classification_CWRU_Bearing" datatest, fault detection "CWRU Bearing Dataset" is called and by using MLP neural network model, the task of separating normal and fault data has been done.
* In the third code named "Mini_projectt2_Problem3_DecissionTree_Drug", the process of calling the "Drugs dataset" and using the "Decision Tree" method, the type of disease and its appropriate drug are classified.
* In code "Mini_project2_problem4_Bayes_Heart_disease", the heart disease dataset has been called and separated using the Bayes model classification method.
