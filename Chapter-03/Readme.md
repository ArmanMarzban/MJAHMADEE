# In this section, the codes of the miniproject03 are presented:
## In this mini project, the following has been done:
* In code *Problem_1_SVM (2)*, using the üñ•Ô∏è **SVM** machine model, the data of **Iris flower** is classified. Also, by using **PCA** and **LDA** dimension reduction methods, the performance of the class model has been improved.
* In code *problem3_autoencoder_credit_cardFraudDetection*, dimension reduction and important feature extraction for *Unbalanced* and *Balanced* data have been done using **Autoencoders**.
