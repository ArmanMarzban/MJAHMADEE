 ## In this mini project, the following codes are simulated:
* In the first code named *Problem1*, the process of forming a random dataset using the skLearn library and classifying them has been done.
* In the code with the name of *Problem2* atatest fault detection **CWRU Bearing Dataset** call and using **Logistic Regression** machine model, the work of separating normal and fault data has been done.
